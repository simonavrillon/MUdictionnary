# MUdict
This repository provides access to the code and data used in the preprint: 'The decoding of extensive samples of motor units in human muscles reveals the rate coding of entire motoneuron pools.' (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.25.568607v1). You can first visualise the motor unit pulse trains from the files and reprocess the decomposition and/or manual editing using the Matlab app MUedit (https://github.com/simonavrillon/MUedit). For a specific description of the different variables in the files, please read the User Manual of MUedit.

The code from th repository MUdict will specifically enable you to track motor units across contractions to create a dictionary of unique motor units.

# Data
You will find all the data on Figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24640944.v1). You have 16 participants (S1 to S18) performing either a knee extension (KE) or a dorsiflexion (DF). EMG signals were respectively recorded from the Vastus Lateralis or the Tibialis Anterior with four grids of 64 electrodes during trapezoidal contractions reaching 10% to 80% of the maximal force.
